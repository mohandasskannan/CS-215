/*
 * Course: CS215-00x
 * Project: Lab 12
 * Purpose: To reverse each text line, say original, from the user input
 *          Then decide if each of original,is a palindrome or not
 *          A palindrome is defined as a sequence of characters which
 *                       reads the same backward as forward
